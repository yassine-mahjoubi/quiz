The app, built with **Vue 3**, scrapes content from a URL via an abstraction layer that relies on **Jina Reader**'s technology (with a fallback to a custom solution using **jsdom**). This content is then converted into LLM-optimized Markdown and used as context for the **Gemini API**. You can choose from **three different Gemini models** to generate the quiz."

For more relevant questions, simply provide a link to a web page: the artificial intelligence will focus on its content to create the quiz. Generation is powered by Google's Gemini AI. It's important to remember that AI, while powerful, can sometimes make mistakes or 'hallucinate' answers. Be sure to check critical information. Please also note that this project is a demonstration and uses models with potentially limited access, which might occasionally slow down quiz creation. Feel free to create your own quiz, or explore the gallery to try those already created by the community!"
