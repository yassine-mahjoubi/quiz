Use this quiz as a learning aid, not as an absolute reference!",

      "description": "This app makes 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation' (RAG) accessible to everyone - no expertise required. Here's how it works: [Jina AI Reader](https://jina.ai/reader/) scrapes your URL and converts it into structured, AI-friendly content. [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev) then uses this content as its sole source of truth to craft relevant quiz questions. No URL? Gemini falls back on its general knowledge to generate questions."
