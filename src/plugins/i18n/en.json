    "techdetails_description": "Our goal is to let you benefit from 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation' (RAG) without being an expert. The principle: the AI is 'augmented' with the content you provide. Technically, the `flash` model from [Jina AI Reader](https://jina.ai/reader/) reads the URL and transforms it into clean Markdown optimized for AIs (LLM-Friendly). This text is then passed to [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev) which uses it as the single source of truth for the quiz. Without a URL, Gemini relies on its general knowledge."
